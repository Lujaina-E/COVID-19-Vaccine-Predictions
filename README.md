### Vaccine Priority Tracker
 # Inspiration 
I was inspired to build something relating to the COVID-19 vaccine rollout after I got my vaccine and listening from several sources that they had no access to vaccines where they are. This personally bothered me as I know vaccine arrival to Alberta is central, and so the problem is clearly within the dispersion system from AHS to local hospitals and pharmacies across zones, as well as the priority through which age groups are able to book vaccines fairly. 

# How it works

# Challenges
- Importing proper data that fit the criteria of what I needed to achieve my main goal as planned
- isolating the slope and comparing it against the slope of the other line after pulling data 

# What I learned
Planning out the project beforehand, especially when regression is involved, is very helpful because I won't know what kind of data I'm be exposed to. I also learned the details of how to interpret the data that I'm using, and the slope of the line of best fit. This was especially apparent because I had to be able to isolate the x-values of the intersection point of different lines to be able to decide what demographic the program should suggest increased exposure to the vaccine for.
